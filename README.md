## Hola 👋

My name is Marina, and I am a chemist and former translator now working as a software engineer. 

- 💬 Ask me about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Elixir, Phoenix, esolangs or creative coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email to marinavega@protonmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her.
- 🔮 Misc: I love photography, chess, playing bass, learning new languages, animals, and binge-watching The Simpsons.

### How I like to work

- I like improving development workflows and tooling so teams can move faster with less friction.  
- I prefer solutions that are maintainable and clear rather than complex for the sake of it.
- I love working end-to-end, from early discussions and shaping the idea to implementation and refinement.
- I value decisions that make sense in the long term, not just in the moment.
- I like taking time to understand the problem properly before committing to one approach.
